# First commit
This is first....i would say assignment on a blog application. the initial functionalities are an authentication system, a register user,
when logged in can make a post, can also update his or her profile..
By tomorrow, i'll add an authorization or would i say a permission system to keep unregistered users out except from the login and signup page and also add and Update and Delete Post functionality
to complete it. CreateReadUpdateDelete....for now it's a CreateRead...lolðŸ˜‚

# second commit 
Now, the user can update his or her post. Also a user has rights to only his or ser post. A user can edit or delete another user's post. I also added a functionality that lets logged in users not to be able to view the login and signup pages, an unregistered user can't view the home and other important pages 

tho the decorators i used... ie @login_required was django built-in and the other @anonymous_required was a copy and paste...it's still abit confusing tho but i just wanted that functionality to be up and running.
